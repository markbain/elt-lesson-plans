# ELT Lesson Plans WordPress Plugin
## By Mark Bain
This WordPress plugin allows teachers to add lesson plans to their WordPress site as a Custom Post Type, with the option to enter specific information, such as:

- Lesson duration
- Language focus
- Level

What's more, there's the option of embedding or linking to a video, and adding a list of downloadable resources.
